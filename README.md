# CryptoColaMachine

This discord bot was designed specifically for the now-defunct CryptoCola discord server.

The main purpose of this bot was to serve as a faucet for the server that utilized the [tip.cc](https://tip.cc/) discord bot before an API existed.

The bot did 3 things:

- Allow only airdrops in a channel
- Auto-collect airdrops in any server the bot is in (to fund the faucet)
- Check the price of a token
- Provide a faucet where:
    - Users with special ranks could get periodic rewards
    - Users with special ranks get more from faucets
    - Server members can choose any coin and get more
    - Nonserver members can only get minimum amount
- And miscellaneous functions


The server is long gone, so I made the source code public. Chappy, I hope you don't mind.

Most of this code doesn't work anymore, but the token price checker is useful.

Enjoy.
